# Tic-Tac-Toe

The Tic-Tac-Toe game is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. This project provides a simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game in C#. It allows players to take turns, make moves, and determines the winner or a draw condition.

## Getting Started

To play the Tic-Tac-Toe game, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project files to your local machine.

2. Open the project in your preferred C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).

3. Build the project to compile the source code.

4. Run the application, and the game will start in the console window.

5. Players will take turns entering their moves by providing the row and column numbers.

6. The game will display the updated board after each move.

7. If a player achieves a winning combination or the game ends in a draw, the game will announce the result.

8. To start a new game, run the application again.

## Screenshots

Include one or more screenshots of the game in action to provide a visual representation of the gameplay.
